# Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to hold two functions, "calculate_stream_depletions" and "map_stream_depletions". These functions estimate by analytical equations the depletions experienced on stream reaches as a function of pumping and a map of the impact of wells on nearby streams respectively. The former uses linear superposition, assuming the aquifer responds linearly, to overlay the pumping at well locations and can accommodate user specified variable pumping rates. The latter assumes a unit constant pumping rate to estimate at a given well location how much of the extracted water is from storage and how much from depletion after user specified timesteps. The author would like to stress that there are no new ideas contained within this code, and they serve rather as convenient ways for the user to create depletion maps and estimates without writing the methods themselves. Please see within each folder more detailed documentation, references, and examples. Documentation of variables, assumptions, and references are mostly the same within each folder, as the functions are inverses of eathother.
