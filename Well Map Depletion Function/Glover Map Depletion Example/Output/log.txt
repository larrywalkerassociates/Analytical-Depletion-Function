#### Opening program to calculate stream depletion

#### Calculating Impacted Segments For Each Well
Well segment proximity criteria:  Local Area
Streams not preprocessed to points ... converting to points
Number of unique stream segments:  86
Mean | Median number of points per segment:  31 | 19
Mean | Median impacted segment length in meters:  128664|128792
Found impacted segments without error
Moving to next step ...

#### Apportioning Depletions For Each Well
Well apportionment criteria:  Inverse Distance
For each well, finding the closest point on the reaches that it impacts
Max | Mean | Median number of reaches effected per well:  77 | 52 | 51
Max apportioned depletion fraction:  0.7628 for reach 5 for well 74
Apportioned depletions without error
Moving to next step ...

#### Calculating Depletions For Each Well
Using analytical model:  Glover
Mean | Median start of stream depletions (timestep):  1.03  |  1
Mean | Median final depletions (meters^3): 14.6473 | 12.6347 at timestep (t_final) 595
Max final depletions (meters^3): 92.254 at timestep (t_final) 595 for reach 11
Mean | Median Jenkins SDF 60961.4265 | 61196.5406
Calculated depletions without error
