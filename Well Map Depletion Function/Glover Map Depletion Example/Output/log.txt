#### Opening program to calculate stream depletion

#### Calculating Impacted Segments For Each Well
Well segment proximity criteria:  Local Area
Number of rows in well grid = 104
Number of columns in well grid = 74
Streams not preprocessed to points ... converting to points
Number of unique stream segments:  86
Mean | Median number of points per segment:  31 | 19
Mean | Median impacted segment length in meters:  103323|99513
Found impacted segments without error

#### Apportioning Depletions For Each Well
Well apportionment criteria:  Inverse Distance
For each well, finding the closest point on the reaches that it impacts
Max | Mean | Median number of reaches effected per well:  79 | 43 | 42
Max apportioned depletion fraction:  0.9839 for reach 25 for well 5855
Apportioned depletions without error
Moving to next step ...

#### Calculating Depletions For Each Well
Using analytical model:  Glover
Mean | Median time to custom SDF time (0.5):  69.1  |  46.49 [timesteps]
Mean | Median final depletions (meters^3): 0.4966 | 0.5094 at timestep (t_final) 50
Max final depletions (meters^3): 0.9925 at timestep (t_final) 50 for well at row 5855
Calculated depletions without error
